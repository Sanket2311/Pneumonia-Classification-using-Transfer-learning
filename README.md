# Pneumonia-Classification-using-Transfer-learning
In this project we'll Use Transfer learning using VGG16 model and customize our model to predict whether a person has Pneumonia.

Environment: Google Colab
Dataset: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

In this .ipynb notebook we have directly imported dataset from kaggle to google colab, unzipped the dataset and trained model on it.

At the we have achieved pretty impressive 96% in-sample and 91.5% Validation accuracy!!!

Learned a lot while working on this cool project!!
